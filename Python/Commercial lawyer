Commercial Lawyer

Temporary assignment


The Commercial Law team handles a sizeable number of contracts with providers of creative and market research services. Over the recent years, we have seen an increase in our direct involvement when it comes to handling Intellectual Property Right release forms and contributor/artist contracts with individuals who take part in the production of consumer engagement materials addressed to adult smokers.

There is a need to optimize and streamline our contractual landscape to be able to provide a more agile support to our business colleagues.

There is also a need to review the agreements in line with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 effective May 25, 2018 (GDPR).
